graphgenerator
==============

A simple graph generator for NIID(0)
I did this to help a friend in generating graphs using the GNU Plot tool from auto generated data. It has to 2 operation (command) moods. Either you can generate the graphs one by one using a 'single' mode or you can usea config file.
